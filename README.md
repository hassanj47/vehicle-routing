# vehicle-routing

A consulting project on multiple vehicle routing I did for an ecommerce startup. I am releasing a portion of the anonymized dataset as the business has closed operations a while back.

This is a multi-objective optimization problem that seeks to identify optimal routes for a fleet of cargo trucks while minimizing fleet allocation and minimizing distance travelled.

The solution consists of two parts: the first part deals with vehicle loading and minimizing fleet allocation. It is solved through linear programming. The second part is finding optimal routes to minimize distance travelled and is based on a heuristic solution of the travelling salesman problem.
